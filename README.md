The objective of this project is to develop a backend system for managing academic conferences using RESTful APIs. 
This system interacts with a database to handle various entities related to conferences. Core features include organizing conference details and processing manuscript submissions from participants.

#how_to_run_it
In the VS Code terminal, run npm install to install all required dependencies (these will be placed in a node_modules directory, which is typically excluded from version control due to its large size). 
After the installation is complete, start the server by running npm start.
